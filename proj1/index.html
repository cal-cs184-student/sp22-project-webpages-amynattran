        <h1>CS 184 Assignment 1: Rasterizer</h1>
        <h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
        <p>
            In order to rasterize triangles, my function took in 3 points that represent the corners of the triangle. I iterated over every single pixel
			that is within the minimum and maximum x and y value for the three points. This ensures that I check all points that are inside of the triangle.
			I was able to check if each point was inside of the triangle by first determining if the points were given to me in a clockwise manner, or counter clockwise
			by checking if the third point was above or below the line that is creaeted by the first two points. Using this information, I was able to determine
			if any given point was in the triangle by checking to make sure that it is above all 3 lines created by the 3 points of the triangle. <br>
			Since I check every since pixel in the bounding box, this has the same run time as another algorithm that would check each sample within 
			the bounding box of the triangle.

        <h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
        <p>In order to implement super sampling, I first changed the size of the sample buffer to be [width * height * sample_rate]. \
			I did this so that every pixel would have sample_rate indices in the sample buffer for me to down sample later. 
			In order to super sample, I checked if sample_rate number of samples within a pixel was inside of the triangle. 
			If it was in the triangle, then the appropriate index in the sample buffer was changed to the color specified. 
			In the function resolve_to_framebuffer, for each pixel, I averaged out the sample_rate number of indices that correspond 
			to the subpixels for the pixel I care about. This got reid of jaggies, and made the triangles appear smoother. 
			In order to make sure that these changes worked properly, I also had to change fill_pixel so that one point fills in sample_rate 
			indices in the sample buffer to ensure that the whole pixel is filled in with that color.

		<p>
			If you look at the zoomed in portion, you can tell that the skinny triangle looks disconnected in the first image 
			with a sample rate of 1, but as we increase the sample rate, it connects the triangle because the sub pixels are considered 
			part of the triangle so we are able to get color where we need it. Supersampling allows us to draw more accurate traingles.

        <h2>Task 4: Barycentric Coordinates</h2>
        <p>
			Basically, barycentric coordinates are a way of representing points within a triangle. barycentric coordinates 
			tell you the ratio of the points of the triangle that when combined give you your wanted point. For example, in the image below, 
			the black point is inside this triangle that has points colored red, green, and blue.  In the same way that we 
			can represent the color at that black point as a combination of red, green and blue, we can represent the 
			location at that point as a combination of the location of the red green and blue points. In order to determine the points location 
			within the triangle, we can use the equations given in class which is also shown below. (&alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;) is our
			barycentric coordinate. If we have (&alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;) for our black dot, we can find the (x, y) representation of it by
			doing (x, y) = &alpha; * red + &beta; * blue + &gamma; * green. You can also use similar logic ot find the color at the black dot.

        <h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
        <p>
			The way I think about pixel sampling is that you texture has all of the colors that you want, but it is flat. 
			We want to take the colors from our texture and rearrange them in a way so that it takes the shape that we tell it to. 
			In order to do this, I used barycentric coordinates to map (x, y) values in my frame buffer to (u, v) coordinates from the texture. 
			There since (u, v) is most likely not a whole number, there are a few methods to determine what color to sample from the texture. One of 
			these methods is nearest pixel, which basically just matches the color of the nearest whole pixel to the (u, v). Another method is bilinear 
			interpolation. This basically takes the 4 nearest pixel colors, and interpolates the color value for (u, v) based on its distance from 
			each of the 4 points. This method makes images look smoother since pixels will blend into one another better.

		<p>
			As can be seen above, bilinear interpolation creates a smoother picture particularly in the lines. The nearest pixel with a sample_rate of 1
			fails to connect the vertical white line. it has holes in it, but the bilinear method is able to smoothly create the white lines at a sample_rate of 1. 
			I think that the difference between the two sampling methods can most clearly be seen when looking at fine details suxh as small straight lines since
			it is easy for our eyes to notice things like this. I thinkt that the bilinear interpolation smoothly transitions between colors where as the nearest pixel might have sudden changes 
			in color where we might not expect it. 
		</p>


        <h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
        <p>
			Level sampling is a method that is used to makes sure that things that are far away do not look aliased, and while also making sure that things that
			are close to use remain in focus or clear. For my texture mapping, we were already given the different levels that we can sample from, but for each 
			subpixel, I had to determine the level of the mipmap that I would sample from absed on how much my (u,v) value changed when I added 1 to the x or y 
			value. I used the equation given to us in class, but similarly to our (u,v) coordinates, the level that we are given is rarely a whole number, so 
			this requires us to choose a sampling method to decide which level to use. Just like with pixel sampling, we can use nearest, or bilinear to choose which 
			level to sample from. <br>
			In terms of the speed of different sampling methods, increasing the sample rate will increase the run time since you will have to sample more points. Bilinear
			methods for pixel and level sampling will take longer than theri nearest counterpart since you will have to sample more from the texture when you do bilinear
			whereas when you do nearest you only need to sample once ber (u, v) coordinate. In terms of memory usage, increasing the sample rate will increase the amount of 
			memory needed since we will need to increase the size of the sample_buffer. For my implementation, I will have to create more objects for bilinear sampling
			sampling, so the memory usage is a bit more for that than nearest. In terms of antialiasing power, higher sampling rates are better for antialiasing, and bilinear 
			sampling is better for both pixel and level selection.
